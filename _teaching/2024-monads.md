I made a short presentation about monads for graduate students familiar with the OCaml programming language.

The goal was to explain, in a presentation time, the famous quote attributed to Philip Wadler by James Iry: "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, whatâ€™s the problem?". You may find a category theory speedrun with as little theory as possible and as many illustrations as possible.
