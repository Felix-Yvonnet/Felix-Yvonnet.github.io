I did a 6 months internship at the UNIST university in Ulsan, South Korea, on the project [RuntimeAPR](https://github.com/FreddyYJ/RuntimeAPR) (also named Axolotl). I was working on an improved Python interpreter that would fix programs' crashes on the fly under the supervision of [Jooyong Yi](https://www.jooyongyi.com/).

You can find below a poster I presented during a workshop in Gyeongju.
