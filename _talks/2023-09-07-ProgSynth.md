I did a 2 months internship at the LaBRI computer science lab in Bordeaux, France on the project [ProgSynth](https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/ProgSynth). I tried to adapt the restarts method from SAT solvers to program synthesis under the supervision of [Théo Matricon](https://theomat.github.io/) and [Nathanaël Fijalkow](https://games-automata-play.com/).

You can find below the slides of my presentation in French.
